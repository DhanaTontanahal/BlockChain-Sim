Block Chain:
Chain of cryptograhic blocks of information.

The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.
They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.
In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees to the design, 
which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block

A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, 
that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. 
It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".

For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol 
for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. 

Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks,
which requires consensus of the network majority.

 Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and
 exemplify a distributed computing system with high fault tolerance.
 
The repo simulates the block chain technology implemented using javascript.

There can be many ways of doing the same , bu this is the humble try from my end to learn, understand and represent the block chain technology.


We want our block to be part of block chain

>b----b1<--->b2<---->b3<--->and so on
Some properties of block include:
1.)index, timestamp created , data/information , previous hash.
